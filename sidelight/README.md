WS2812 sidelight

5 WS2812-breakout boards make up a cube with 4 sides and a lid. Underneath
fits a ATTiny microcontroller with a tiny little program inside. Its main
purpose is to replace the flimsy electronic candle lights with a single
LED and a coin cell battery with more power. In addition it brings also
more color.

Things you'll need:
- 5 WS2812 breakout boards (from your favorite electronics supply)
- an ATTiny 25/45/85
- a small piece of prototype pcb
- a 560Ohm resistor
- a 12kOhm resistor
- a 22kOhm resistor
- a 100nF capacitor
- a 10ÂµF (or similar) capacitor
- a 2xAA battery holder
- a 5V step up breakout board
- the program from this project loaded into the microcontroller
